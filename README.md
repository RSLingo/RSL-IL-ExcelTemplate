This repository publishes the “RSL-IL Excel Template” that is a SRS template based on the multi-view architecture defined in the RSL-IL language [1,2] and also that is aware of the problems and practical recommendations discussed [4,5]. 

This template includes the following files:
• RSLIL-ExcelTemplate-v1.1.xlsx: the RSL-IL Excel template that can be customized or directly used in a project basis;
• RSLIL-ExcelTemplate-TechnicalReport-v1.1.pdf: a technical report that briefly describes this template and gives some additional information. 
• RSLIL-Example-BillingSystem-v1.0.xlsx: a companion Excel file with a very simple (and not complete) application example of this RSL-IL Excel template;


Feel free to use it at your convenience!
