RSL-IL System Requirements Specification - MS-Excel Template
-
Requirements specifications (SRSs) describe multiple technical concerns of a system and are used throughout different stages of the project life-cycle to help sharing the system vision among the main stakeholders, as well as to facilitate communication and the overall project management and system development processes. For achieving an effective communication, everyone should be able to communicate by means of a common language, and natural language provides the foundations for such language. However, although natural language is the most common and preferred form of requirements representation, it also exhibits some intrinsic characteristics that often present themselves as the root cause of many requirements quality problems, such as incorrectness, inconsistency, incompleteness and ambiguousness. 

The RSL-IL is a requirements specification language that includes several constructs logically arranged into viewpoints according to the specific RE concerns they address. 

The “RSL-IL Excel Template” is a SRS template based on the RSL-IL Language that can be customized or just directly used for your own purpose.
