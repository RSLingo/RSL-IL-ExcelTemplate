Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository publishes the “RSL-IL Excel Template” that is a SRS template based on the multi-view architecture and inspired on the design of several languages such as RSL-IL [1,2], XIS* [5,6] and SilabREQ [7], and also that is aware of the problems and practical recommendations discussed in the community, such as in [4,5].

This template includes the following files:
- RSLIL-ExcelTemplate-vX.Y.xlsx: the RSL-IL Excel template that can be customized or directly used in a project basis (please use its most recent version)
- RSLIL-ExcelTemplate-TechnicalReport-v1.1.pdf: a technical report that briefly describes this template and gives some additional information (not updated with the last version).
- RSLIL-Example-BillingSystem-vX.Y.xlsx: a companion Excel file with a simple (and not complete) application example of this RSL-IL Excel template; Use its last version as a starting point for your learning and use purposes
